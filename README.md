# Standalone Reservation Management System

This project is a **Standalone Reservation Management System** developed using **C#** and **SQL**. It is designed to facilitate the staff of a music studio in managing various business operations such as handling customer reservations, purchases, inventory, and accounts. The system also implements **Role-Based Access Control**, ensuring that staff members have appropriate permissions based on their roles.

This project focuses on providing staff with a robust, standalone solution for managing all internal processes related to the studio's daily operations. The system allows staff to manage customer data, oversee reservations and hires, track inventory, manage staff records, and handle financial accountingâ€”all in an intuitive desktop application.

## Installation Guide

### Step 1: Install SQL Server and Management Studio
1. Download and install [Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) and [SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16).
2. After installation, open SSMS and start your SQL Server instance.

### Step 2: Set up the Database
In **SSMS**, create a new database for the system. You can name it `MusicStudioDB`.

### Step 3: Configure the Database Connection in the Application
1. In the `<connectionStrings>` section, modify the connection string to match your SQL Server configuration:
    ```xml
    <connectionStrings>
        <add name="MusicStudioDB"
             connectionString="Data Source=YOUR_SERVER_NAME;Initial Catalog=MusicStudioDB;Integrated Security=True" 
             providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
    </connectionStrings>
    ```
   - Replace `YOUR_SERVER_NAME` with the name of your SQL Server instance.

### Step 4: Build and Run the Application
1. Open the `Music Studio.sln` solution file in **Visual Studio**.
2. Build the project by selecting `Build > Build Solution`.
3. Once the build succeeds, run the application by pressing `F5` or selecting `Debug > Start Debugging`.

### Step 5: Logging In
You can create a default user and change the credentials from the database via **SSMS**.
